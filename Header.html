<td>About
<div><div class="contd"><img alt="." src="storke/FearTheMindFlayer.jpg" class="imgInText">Welcome to my World of Warcraft wallpapers gallery! The first part of the gallery features panoramas from in-game scenes. 
The second half contains screenshots. Hovering over the names of the images brings up more information. 
All panoramas are offered in 2 resolutions: full size and 2560x1440 (8:5 aspect, may be cropped).<br/><br/>

Starting with the games release in February 2005 I played an undead mage named 
<a class="subtleDashed" href="storke/241Storke_432576.png">Storke</a> 
on the German server Lothar. I was part of the fraction-leading raid guild MC1 and later founder and guild leader of
<a class="subtleDashed" href="306Evolution_1280720.jpg">Evolution</a> until <a class="subtleDashed" href="storke/bye2.jpg">I quit</a> playing in the summer of 2007. The YAR guild was the last known decendent.<br/><br/>

My interest in taking these in-game photos developed alongside my fascination to play the game. 
A big inspiration at the time were <a class="subtleDashed" href="http://www.nebdaar.com/wow/">nebdaar's panoramas</a>. 
I started to get more involved with panoramas and picture manipulation. This is how this gallery developed.
